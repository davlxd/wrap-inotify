-----------
    o A thread is created to filter specific directory events in a loop, 
      so watch descriptors can be added/removed dynamically
    o Organize all directory watchers as two hashtables and a tree

3.  Usage
---------
    #include "wrap-inotify.h"

    int init_watchers(const char *path, uint32_t mask, int64 size);

        path -> path you want to watch
        mask -> watch mask argument for inotify_add_watch()
        size -> initial hashtable size (approximate subdirectory amount)
